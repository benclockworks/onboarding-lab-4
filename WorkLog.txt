benchikbayor@benchiks-Mac build % cmake --help-policy CMP0144
CMP0144
-------

.. versionadded:: 3.27

``find_package()`` uses upper-case ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` variables.

In CMake 3.27 and above the ``find_package(<PackageName>)`` command now
searches prefixes specified by the upper-case ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
CMake variable and the ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` environment variable
in addition to the case-preserved ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` and
``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables used since policy ``CMP0074``.
This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been
updated to avoid using ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` variables for other purposes.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
variables if the original ``<PackageName>`` has lower-case characters.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.27.  CMake version
3.27.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0144
-------

.. versionadded:: 3.27

``find_package()`` uses upper-case ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` variables.

In CMake 3.27 and above the ``find_package(<PackageName>)`` command now
searches prefixes specified by the upper-case ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
CMake variable and the ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` environment variable
in addition to the case-preserved ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` and
``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables used since policy ``CMP0074``.
This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been
updated to avoid using ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` variables for other purposes.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
variables if the original ``<PackageName>`` has lower-case characters.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.27.  CMake version
3.27.1 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

  @response_file         Contains one argument per line expanded at that location

Package Installation:
  export                 Creates a standalone deployment of installed ports
  install                Installs a package
  remove                 Uninstalls a package
  x-set-installed        Installs, upgrades, or removes packages such that that installed matches
                         exactly those supplied
  upgrade                Rebuilds all outdated packages

Package Discovery:

  owns                   Searches for the owner of a file in installed packages
  x-package-info         Display detailed information on packages
  portsdiff              Diffs changes in port versions between commits
  search                 Searches for packages available to be built
  update                 Lists packages that can be upgraded

Package Manipulation:
  add                    Adds dependency to manifest
  x-add-version          Adds a version to the version database
  create                 Creates a new port
  edit                   Edits a port, optionally with $EDITOR, defaults to "code"
  env                    Creates a clean shell environment for development or compiling
  format-manifest        Prettyfies vcpkg.json
  hash                   Gets a file's SHA256 or SHA512
  x-init-registry        Creates a blank git registry
  new                    Creates a new manifest
  x-update-baseline      Updates baselines of git registries in a manifest to those registries' HEAD
                         commit

Other:
  ci                     Tries building all ports for CI testing
  x-ci-verify-versions   Checks integrity of the version database
  contact                Displays contact information to send feedback
  fetch                  Fetches something from the system or the internet
  integrate              Integrates vcpkg with machines, projects, or shells

CMake Warning (dev) at build/_deps/vcpkg-src/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
